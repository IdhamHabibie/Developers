# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Started with SVM
This repository will answer the Kaggle competition as described in this https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started. The method that I am using is SVM (Support Vector Machine) using Python. I have uploaded the dataset file from **Kaggle**. 
We have two files in this project, which are : 
  1. [Data Training](../master/train.csv)
  2. [Testing Data](../master/test.csv)
